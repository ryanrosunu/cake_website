**Iteractive Features**
1. Changing Link Color
I chose to implement an interactive feature that changes the text color of of each individual navigation link button to blue 
when hovered over with a mouse and reverts back to normal when no longer hovered over. This applies to the main navigation 
links as well as the gallery navigation links.

2. Changing Button Color
I chose to implement an interactive feature that changes the background color of each individual button to blue when hovered 
over with a mouse and reverts back to normal when no longer hovered over. This applies to all buttons on the website.

3. Confirm Order Interaction
I chose to implement an interactive feature to the "Place Order" button on the order page that uses a confirm popup. When a
user clicks the "Place Order" button, they will be prompted to confirm their submission of the order. If "OK" is clicked,
the user is redirected to the thank you page, otherwise, the user remains on the order page where they can continue editing
their order. If javascript is disabled, clicking "Place Order" will automatically send the user to the thank you page.
